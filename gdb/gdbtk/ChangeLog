	* generic/gdbtk-bp.c (gdb_get_breakpoint_info): Use
	breakpoint_commands to access breakpoint commands.
	(gdb_get_tracepoint_info): Likewise for tracepoint actions.

	* generic/gdbtk-bp.c (gdb_get_breakpoint_info): Breakpoint
	commands are now reference counted. Adjust data pointers.
	(gdb_get_tracepoint_info): Likewise.
	(gdb_actions_command): Don't free previous actions. If the
	commands aren't valid, we would prefer to keep the old ones
	any way. break_point_set_commands will also clobber any
	previous results anyway.

2010-03-24  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* generic/gdbtk-bp.c (gdb_set_bp): set_breakpoint is no more.
	Use create_breakpoint.
	(gdbtk_obj_array, gdbtk_obj_array_ptr, gdbtk_obj_array_cnt):
	New globals.
	(gdbtk_read_next_line): New function.
	(gdb_actions_command): Rewrite using new command_line
	infrastructure.
	(gdb_get_tracepoint_info): Actions are now stored in the breakpoint
	struct's commands element.

	* generic/gdbtk-cmds.c: Include psymtab.h, not psympriv.h.
	(struct listfiles_info): New.
	(do_listfiles): New function.
	(gdb_listfiles): Use it.

	* generic/gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_set_inferior_args): set_inferior_args
	now works as expected. Do not strdup/free the argument string.

2010-01-15  Stan Shebs  <stan@codesourcery.com>

	* generic/gdbtk-bp.c (gdb_trace_status): Use current_trace_status.

2010-01-04  Keith Seitz  <keiths@redhat.com>

	* generic/gdbtk-cmds.c (gdbtk_load_asm): print_address_symbolic
	requires the architecture, too.
