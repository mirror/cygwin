1999-06-16  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* itk/win/Makefile.in (install-man): Don't install *.3 -- there
	are no manpages in this section.

1999-03-26  Martin Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/scrolledwidget.itk 
	(iwidgets::Scrolledwidget::sbwidth): The default width of 15
	was incompatible with Windows.  Change the default to "" and
	only actually change the scrollbar width if someone changes
	it to something else.

1999-03-22  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/unix/configure.in: Leave the LD_SEARCH_PATH off of
	MAKE_LIBS.  This loses on OSF with --enable-shared.
	* itcl/unix/configure: regenerated
	* itk/unix/configure.in: Leave the LD_SEARCH_PATH off of

1999-03-18  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Don't bother with
	making symlinks for other versions of iwidgets -- we don't use them.	

1999-03-03  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk (_reconfigure): Make sure 
	that the widget has not been destroyed while in the update
	idletasks.  FIXME - see if we can eliminate the need for this
	update. 

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk (clientHandlesConfigure): 
	Added method to allow the user of the labeled frame to do the
	reconfigure, so this can be batched up and reduce flashing.

1999-02-24  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/labeledframe.itk: Make it derive from Widget
	not Archetype (which was a BAD idea).  Add an interposing frame so 
	you didn't have to much with the highlightthickness of the
	MegaWidget itself.  Doing this allows you to actually use the
	labeledframe in derived classes.
	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/scrolledwidget.itk: Derive from labeledframe,
	not labeledwidget.  This way you can add a relief around the
	label, which looks better for scrolled text, scrolled listboxes
	and scrolled canvases.
	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic scrolledcanvas.itk, scrolledlistbox.itk,
	scrolledtext.itk: Pushed throught the changes needed to get the
	derivation from labeledframe to work.

	like.

1999-02-18  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/unix/Makefile.in itk/unix/Makefile.in: fix the install
	target so it points to itclConfig.sh in the itcl or itk, rather
	than in the itcl/unix or itk/unix directories.
	* itcl/win/configure.in: use the ITCLCYGRC & ITCLCYGSHRC variables 
	in the name of the windres output file.
	* itcl.rc: For some reason, windres is choking on STRINGIFY of the 
	Itcl version numbers.  Some day we should figure out why.  For
	now, I just put in the version numbers by hand.

	* Makefile.in: Propogate make errors from subdirectories
	back to the top level.

	Figure out all of the appropriate directories at this level
	so that cygwin and msvc differences can be accounted for.
	* itcl/win/configure: Regenerate.
	* itcl/win/Makefile.in: Use OBJEXT.
	Set build directories correctly.
	Set -DDLL_BUILD, -DSTATIC_BUILD, and -DBUILD_itcl correctly.

	* itk/win/configure.in: Moved itkConfig.sh. Look for itclConfig.sh
	in new place. Fixed problems finding tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh.

	tree can call it.

	Added exporting of TCL_LIB_FULL_PATH.
	Generate and export ITCL_LIB_FULL_PATH.
	* itcl/itcl/unix/configure: Regenerated

	-fwritable-strings is enabled.
	Add dependency for TCL_LIB_FULL_PATH.
	* itcl/itclConfig.sh.in: Moved from lower directory.
	* itcl/itk/unix/configure.in: Moved itkConfig.sh.in up a level.

1999-01-21  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/library/init.tcl (auto_import): Comment out this function.
	It does not work, because it can not populate the source
	namespace's export list.  There is no easy way to fix this, and
	since it is just an optimization over the original Tcl proc, we
	will just use Tcl one for now.

1999-01-20  James Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* itcl/library/init.tcl: updated to Itcl 3.0.1.  Does not force
	the addition of class to the auto_mkindex_parser namespace, but
	uses the namespace import instead.

1998-12-15  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Reverted back to original
	distribution. The new panedwindow widget is now in libgui.

1998-12-11  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Major changes to

 	the panedwindow to be used as a more general purpose
	container widget where individual parts may or may not be
	resizable.
	
	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/pane.itk (iwidgets::Pane): Added
	-resizable option to support non-resizable panes.

1998-12-08  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* iwidgets3.0.0/generic/panedwindow.itk: Major changes to 
	the default look and resizing method to be more modern, more
	windows-like, and work better when widgets are placed in childsites.
