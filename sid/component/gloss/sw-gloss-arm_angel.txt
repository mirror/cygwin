* Functionality

  - Modelling

    This component emulates the ANGEL ROM monitor software by
    intercepting the ARM CPU component model's software interrupt
    (SWI).  It implements common system calls, such as read() and
    write().

  - Behaviors

    * System call emulation

    When the "trap" input pin is driven, this component will attempt
    to emulate the requested system call.  It checks whether the
    current "trap-code" and "trap" values correspond to a system call 
    that can be emulated.

    If this is indeed a valid ANGEL system call, the component emulates
    the call by accessing the target processor's registers (through the 
    "cpu" relation) and memory (through the "target-memory" accessor).
    In most cases, it signals back a "skip" or "reissue" indication 
    through the "trap" output pin.

    If the requested system call is not a valid ANGEL system call, 
    the trap signal is chained by driving the "trap-code-chain" 
    and "trap-chain" output pins with the same values as received.  
    If an external component is connected to these chain pins, 
    and if that external component signals a "handled" indication 
    back on the "trap-chain" input, then this component will 
    consider the trap as handled and will return.

    If this is a trap condition that would kill an ordinary
    process-model program, then the "process-signal" output pin is
    driven with an exit code similar to that used by UNIX wait(2).
    Such conditions include memory faults, invalid instructions, etc.

    See the documentation of "hw-cpu-arm7t" for the list of supported
    trap & trap-code values.

    If the "verbose?" attribute is set to a true value, detailed
    tracing messages will be printed to stderr during a system call
    emulation.

    * Initialization

    When the "reset" pin is driven, all open files are closed and the
    simulated stdio file handles (0/1/2) are attached to the host's
    same stdio file handles.

    The "heap-base", "heap-limit", "stack-base", "stack-limit", and
    "command-line" attributes provide access to values that are
    exposed to several ANGEL system calls.

    The "max-fds" attribute specifies the largest simulated file
    descriptor that will be made available to the target program.

    * STDIO

    Accesses to the special simulated file handles 0/1/2 are mapped to
    pin I/O on the "debug-tx" and "debug-rx" pins.  Input from the
    "debug-rx" pin is buffered for future reads.  Reads may block
    until data is received.  Writes to stdout or stderr are modelled
    by sending the supplied characters, one-at-a-time, out through the
    "debug-tx" pin.

  - SID conventions

    * This is a supervisory component.
    * It does not support triggerpoints nor state save/restore.
    * It does not limit recursion.

* Environment

  - Related components

    * The Angel component communicates closely with a CPU and main memory.  
      It uses the CPU for retrieving system call arguments from
      registers and placing results in a register.  It uses memory for 
      accessing data when system call arguments are pointers into the
      target memory.  An example of this is the char* argument to write().
      The coupling to the CPU and memory is quite relaxed: the only
      requirement is that the endianness of the CPU be known via attribute
      and that attributes for registers exist with names of the form
      "rN".

    * The configuration file fragment below shows how to connect an 
      Angel component into a more complete system:

	new hw-cpu-arm7t cpu
	new hw-memory-ram/rom-basic mem
	new sw-gloss-arm/angel angel
	new sid-io-stdio stdio
	relate angel cpu cpu
	connect-pin cpu trap <-> angel trap
	connect-pin cpu trap-code -> angel trap-code
	connect-pin angel process-signal -> main stop!
	connect-pin angel debug-tx -> stdio stdout
	connect-pin angel debug-rx <- stdio stdin
	connect-bus angel target-memory cpu debugger-port

  - Host system

    * The component implements the Angel's semi-hosted system calls
      such as open() and close().  Use these calls with caution: they 
      can perform file I/O on the host, therefore it is possible to
      write rogue target programs that delete or modify files on the host.
