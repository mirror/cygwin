  <synop>
  These components manage multiple signal schedules.
  </synop>
  <func>
    <modelling>
      <p> These components function as general purpose signal
      schedulers.  They approximately correspond to a collection of
      programmable clock dividers.
      </p>

      <p>The number of controllable outputs ("subscriptions") is a
      matter of configuration.</p>

      <p>The three component types are identical, except in their
      notions of <attribute>time</attribute>.  See the Timing section below.</p>

    </modelling>

    <behavior name="configuration">
      <p>When the <attribute>num-clients</attribute> is written-to,
      this component adjusts its list of scheduler clients.  Each
      "client" corresponds to a set of "N-" pins and attributes, with
      its own signalling schedule. During configuration, the clients
      can also be named using the <attribute>N-name</attribute>
      attributes, which provides a more informative name for the
      scheduler's TK GUI</p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="timing">
      <p> There is no global concept of simulation time in sid.
      Instead, each scheduler instance maintains its own notion of
      <attribute>time</attribute>.
      </p>

      <p>
	A <component>sid-sched-sim</component> scheduler maintains a 64-bit integer as a
	time counter.  When advancing, this <attribute>time</attribute> counter is set to
	jump forward to the earliest of the upcoming subscribed
	signals.  This way, it represents the clock of a traditional
	event-driven simulator.  </p>

      <p> The <component>sid-sched-host</component> and <component>sid-sched-host-accurate</component>
      schedulers use a millisecond-precision timer of the host
      operating system.  Its <attribute>time</attribute> is simply that of the operating
      system.  When advancing, there may be no scheduled events due,
      even though there may be scheduled events.  In such a case, if
      the <attribute>yield-host-time?</attribute>  attribute is set to <tt>a value greater than or
      equal to yield-host-time-threshold</tt>, a host-time
      scheduler will yield some amount of time to the host operating
      system using a function like usleep().
      </p>

      <p> The <pin>time-query</pin> pin, when driven, causes a scheduler to
      signal its current 64-bit <attribute>time</attribute> back, in two 32-bit halves, on
      the <pin>time-high</pin>, then <pin>time-low</pin> pins.  Similarly, the <attribute>time</attribute>
      attribute may be accessed to get/set the scheduler's time.  
      </p>
      </behavior>

    <behavior name="subscription">
      <p> The scheduler maintains a number of "subscriptions".  Each
      subscription represents a request to provide a series of
      recurring "regular" signals, or a single-shot "irregular"
      signal, some time in the simulation's future.  Each subscription
      has an associated set of pins and attributes to control it.
      </p>

      <p> Each subscription is defined by an index, a
      regular-vs-irregular flag, and a time quantity.  The index is a
      number between 0 and <attribute>num-clients</attribute> -1, and is represented as <tt>N</tt>
      in the pin/attribute list templates in this document.  The
      regular-vs-irregular flag is accessible as the <attribute>N-regular?</attribute> 
      attribute.  The time quantity is accessible as the <attribute>N-time</attribute>
      attribute.  If the value is zero, it is interpreted as a request
      to cancel all pending events for this subscription.  Otherwise,
      the value is taken to be a delta until the <attribute>time</attribute> of the
      requested event.
      </p>

      <p> You can also set these controls by driving encoded values
      into the <pin>N-control</pin> pin.  The top bit is interpreted as the
      regular-vs-irregular flag (1: regular, 0:irregular), and the
      remaining bits as the delta <attribute>time</attribute> value.  If the delta is zero,
      events for this subscription are cancelled.
      </p>

      <p> In each case, the time value sent is multiplied by a scale
      before being merged into the master schedule.  The scaling value
      is available on the <attribute>N-scale</attribute> attribute, and may be specified as
      a plain number, or as a fraction of two numbers (e.g., <tt>1/5</tt>).
      </p>
    </behavior>

    <behavior name="advancing">
      <p> When you have disabled the scheduler by setting the
      <attribute>enabled?</attribute> attribute to a value less than the <attribute>enable-threshold</attribute>
      attribute, advancing as described below, does not occur.
      </p>

      <p> Whenever the <pin>advance</pin> input pin is driven, the scheduler
      may dispatch one or more signals by driving the <pin>N-event</pin> output
      pins with some value.  A counter accessed by the <attribute>advance-count</attribute>
      attribute is incremented. If the attribute <attribute>enabled?</attribute> has
      been changed from a value below <attribute>enable-threshold</attribute> to a value
      greater than or equal to <attribute>enable-threshold</attribute>, then the pin
      <pin>active</pin> will be driven with the value 1. If the attribute
      <attribute>enabled?</attribute> has been changed from a value grater than or equal to
      <attribute>enable-threshold</attribute> to a value less than 
      <attribute>enable-threshold</attribute>, then the pin
      <pin>active</pin> will be driven with the value 0.
      </p>

      <p> Whether any particular <pin>N-event</pin> pin is driven depends on
      the subscription associated with that pin, and the passage of
      that scheduler's <attribute>time</attribute>.  All events that are due "now", or that
      are overdue are dispatched.
      </p>

      <p> If there are multiple due or overdue events, the scheduler
      may loop over the pending event up to <attribute>step-cycle-limit</attribute> number
      of times, as an optimization.  This loop may be aborted early if
      the <pin>yield</pin> input pin is driven.
      </p>

  <title>Related components</title>

    <p>Schedulers may be nested, though normally they are advanced via the
      top level event source (sid-control-cfgroot).</p>
<code>
	new sid-sched-sim target-sched
        new sid-sched-host host-sched
	new SOME_KIND_OF_CPU cpu

  <title>Performance</title>

    <p> These schedulers use data structures and algorithms that attempt
      to be efficient for large number of event subscriptions.</p>

     <p>The <component>sid-sched-host-accurate</component> variety attempts to be accurate to
      1 ms, but this requires many more host OS system calls and
      therefore slows down the simulation.  The basic <component>sid-sched-host</component>
      type of scheduler attempt to be accurate to only 25 ms.  It does 
      this by frequently estimating the host time by adaptive extrapolation.</p>

    <title>High level interface</title>
    <p>
          See the <tt>&lt;sidschedutil.h&gt;</tt> header file for optional utility
      classes.  These use the low level interface below to manage a
      scheduler subscription, or to get scheduler <attribute>time</attribute>.
